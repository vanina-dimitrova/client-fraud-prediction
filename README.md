# Client Fraud Prediction

This research delves into the application of machine learning algorithms to the domain of fraud detection. 

By leveraging a rich dataset of customer transactions, I aim to develop a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent activities with high precision. My approach involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 

Through the implementation of algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, I seek to build a robust and scalable solution to mitigate financial risks associated with customer fraud.
